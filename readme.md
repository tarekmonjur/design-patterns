## [SOLID design principles](https://github.com/tarekmonjur/design-patterns/blob/master/solid-principles/readme.md)

<br />

# Software Architect

* keep many different components in your mind.
* Have a rudimentary knowledge of how they all work.
* Software architects focus on the big picture.
* High-level understanding.

### Best Architects
The best architects aren't dictators, they are teachers.

* Domain base.
* Business base.
* Atomic transaction base.
* Strangler Pattern.
* Sidcar Pattern.

## Integration Pattern
* Gateway Pattern.
* Process Aggregator Pattern.

## Data Pattern
* Single service database.
* shared service database.
* Command Query Responsibility Segregation.
* Asynchronous eventing.

## Operational Pattern
* Log Aggregation Pattern.
* Metrics Aggregation Pattern.
* Tracing Pattern.
* External Configuration.

# Software Architecture Pattern

## Application Landscape Patterns
* Single application to the end user.
* Multiple applications behind the scenes possible.

### Monolith
### N-tier
### Service oriented
### Microservices
### Serverless
### Peer to Peer

## Application Structure Patterns
* Single executable.
* Can be part of a large application landscape.

### Layered
### Microkernel
### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
### Event sourcing

## User Interface Patterns
### Model view controller (MVS)
### Model view presenter (MVP)
### Model view ViewModel (MVVM)
